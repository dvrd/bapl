# Building a programming language

This is my public record of the work done in classpert course on making your own language

## Week 1 - Little Arithmetic Parser
First week is mainly introduction to how lua works and playing around with lpeg (a lua library for PEG parsing)
by creating a grammar to handle numerical computations. Left it with some basic vector operations and factorial as an extra

## Week 2 - Basic interpreter
We start to delve into building an AST from parsing, is still ongoing...
